# üß† Modular RAG Chatbot with GPT-4, Claude, and Open-Source LLMs

This project is a flexible, production-ready **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** chatbot that supports both **open-source language models** (e.g., LLaMA2, Mistral) and **commercial LLM APIs** such as **OpenAI's GPT-4** and **Anthropic's Claude**.

The chatbot retrieves relevant chunks from custom documents using **semantic search**, constructs prompts with contextual grounding, and generates high-quality answers using the selected LLM backend.

  - üß† Open-source models (e.g., LLaMA2, Mistral, Falcon-RW-1B)
  - ü§ñ GPT-4 (OpenAI API)
  - ü§ñ Claude (Anthropic API)
- üìÅ PDF/text document ingestion
- üîé Chunking and semantic retrieval using **FAISS** and **Sentence Transformers**
- üß† Prompt injection with full source context
- üöÄ Backend API using **FastAPI**
- üí¨ Web chat interface built with **Streamlit**
- üê≥ Docker-ready architecture (coming soon)
- üîê `.env` support for API key management

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes & Known Issues

* Anthropic Claude model names are **strict** and change frequently. Confirm the correct one via your [Anthropic dashboard](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/models-overview).
* Local model downloads on Windows may show symlink warnings. Either run Python as Administrator or ignore them ‚Äî downloads still work.
* Some open-source models (like Falcon) don‚Äôt have pad tokens by default. The app sets `pad_token = eos_token` to fix this.

## üöÄ Example Prompt (RAG Flow)

**User Question:**

> "How will AI affect jobs in the future?"

**Retrieved Context:**
*Chunk from PDF about McKinsey‚Äôs prediction of AI job disruption*

jobs it merely serves to steal jobs.

help solve complex problems and make our daily lives easier and more convenient.

‚ÄúImpacted‚Äù is a deliberately neutral term. According to the IMF‚Äôs report, about half of
those impacted by AI will be benefited. The other half will be negatively impacted. For

discussing and preparing for.
Others in the know say that AI has the potential to bring about numerous positive
changes in society both now and in the future, including enhanced productivity,
improved healthcare, and ...

Question: Ai positive effects of all the good points listed are negated by the negative points
which are all related to money and jobs. How will the negative effects be mitigated?
Answer: The main negative points relate to the potential negatives mentioned, like in
the McKinsey report, e.g. robots will eliminate jobs and also the job market is now
increasingly ‚Äúrigged‚Äù, e.g. the job market is already less transparent than ever
before, since people now only compete for jobs that don‚Äôt exist anymore (thanks to AI)        
(
) so AI is also going to affect the jobs market, since it will be even harder to find a good  
job which doesn‚Äôt require skills that have become harder to come by as a result of AI.
But the most important negative is related to how society is structured.
The problem with the way social welfare is set up is that many people live in
‚Äúwelfare‚Äù states but are unable to earn a living because they cannot access a full
standard of living. Such a ‚Äúwelfare state‚Äù is a state system that provides benefits to
those who are considered to be in need by society/ the government. The welfare state
is very expensive (e.g. government expenditures per person are higher than the OECD.
